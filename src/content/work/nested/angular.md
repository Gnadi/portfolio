Angular is the frontend framework that I utilize in my professional work. I have successfully implemented numerous projects with Angular, spanning both Private Banking and Business Banking domains. Additionally, I have accomplished a migration from AngularJS to Angular, specifically in the context of transitioning Private Banking.

I consistently stay abreast of Angular's development through ongoing training sessions, ensuring that I remain up-to-date with the latest advancements. I have gained extensive experience in handling upgrades of Angular versions as well.

I have been actively involved in Angular development since the era of AngularJS, and currently, I exclusively work with the latest Angular version. One aspect of Angular that particularly appeals to me is its asynchronous, component-oriented development approach.
